# Developer Tutorial: Adding a New Category of Tasks

This tutorial presents a step-by-step guide to adding a new
{ref}`dev-categories-of-tasks` to the Polaris Python package (see the
{ref}`glossary` for definitions of terms). In this tutorial, we use the
{ref}`dev-ocean-overflow` as an example.

The tutorial is divided into several pages, each covering a different aspect
of the process.
