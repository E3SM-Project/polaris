# Ocean component

The `ocean` component in polaris contains tasks for the
[MPAS-Ocean](https://mpas-dev.github.io/ocean/ocean.html)) and 
[Omega](https://github.com/E3SM-Project/Omega) components of E3SM.  For more
information on MPAS-Ocean, see the most recent
[user's guide](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1246893) for version 6.  Omega
is still in the early stages of development, but more information will be
provided in the coming months and years.
