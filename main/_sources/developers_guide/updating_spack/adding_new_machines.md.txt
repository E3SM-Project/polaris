# Adding a New Machine

Support for a new HPC machine in Polaris requires coordinated updates
across multiple tools ‚Äî primarily in
[`mache`](https://github.com/E3SM-Project/mache), but also in the E3SM Spack
fork and Polaris deployment scripts.

This page provides guidance for Polaris maintainers and infrastructure
developers integrating new machines into the release and deployment workflow.

## üîó Main Mache Documentation

Most of the process is already documented in the official `mache` developer
guide:

* [Adding a New Machine](https://docs.e3sm.org/mache/main/developers_guide/adding_new_machine.html)
* [Adding Spack Support](https://docs.e3sm.org/mache/main/developers_guide/spack.html)

Start in `mache` to:

* Add a machine-specific config file (e.g., `pm-cpu.cfg`)
* Add hostname detection logic in `discover.py`
* Create Spack templates for supported compiler/MPI stacks
* Optionally add shell script templates for environment setup

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Machines not listed in the E3SM
  [`config_machines.xml`](https://github.com/E3SM-Project/E3SM/blob/master/cime_config/machines/config_machines.xml)
  must first be added upstream before `mache` can support them.

## üß© Integration with Polaris Deployment

After updating `mache`, you'll need to:

1. **Reference your `mache` branch in Polaris Deployment**

   * Use the `--mache_fork` and `--mache_branch` flags to deploy using the
     updated branch
   * Confirm the new machine is recognized and templates are applied correctly

2. **Update Spack if needed**

   * If new versions of external tools are required, update the
     [`spack_for_mache_<version>`](testing/updating_spack_fork.md) branch of the
     [E3SM Spack fork](https://github.com/E3SM-Project/spack)

## ‚úÖ Testing Your Changes

Use the standard test deployment approach from
[Deploying a new spack environment](testing/deploying_spack.md):

```bash
./configure_polaris_envs.py --conda ~/miniforge3 \
                            --mache_fork <your_fork> \
                            --mache_branch <your_branch> \
                            --compiler <compiler> \
                            --mpi <mpi> \
                            --verbose \
                            --recreate
```
You can also supply the `--machine` flag:
```
                            --machine <new_machine> \
```
but it should not be needed if you have set things up correctly in `mache`.

During testing, focus on:

* Spack external package detection and successful builds
* Shell script generation and activation behavior
* Module compatibility and performance of tools

---

## üí° Tips and Best Practices

* Reuse YAML templates from similar machines to minimize effort
* Add common system tools as `buildable: false` in the Spack environment
* Avoid identifying machines using environment variables unless absolutely
  necessary.  Instead use the hostnames for login and compute nodes if
  possible
* Use `utils/update_cime_machine_config.py` to verify `mache` remains in sync
  with E3SM
