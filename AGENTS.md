# Polaris Agent Instructions

These instructions apply to the whole repository unless a deeper
`AGENTS.md` overrides them.

## Source of truth

- Follow the repo's automated style and lint configuration in
  `pyproject.toml` and `.pre-commit-config.yaml`.
- If an instruction here conflicts with automated tooling, follow the
  automated tooling.

## Python style

- Keep Python lines at 79 characters or fewer whenever possible.
- Use `ruff format` style. Do not preserve manual formatting that Ruff
  would rewrite.
- Keep imports at module scope whenever possible. Avoid local imports
  unless they are needed to prevent circular imports, defer expensive
  dependencies, or avoid optional dependency failures.
- Avoid nested functions whenever possible. Prefer private module-level
  helpers instead.
- Put public functions before private helper functions whenever
  practical.
- Name private helper functions with a leading underscore when that fits
  existing repo conventions.

## Validation

- Run relevant pre-commit hooks on changed files before finishing when
  practical.
- Prefer fixing lint and formatting issues rather than suppressing them.
