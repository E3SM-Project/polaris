## description

The `geostrophic` tasks implement the "Global Steady
State Nonlinear Zonal Geostrophic Flow" test case described in
[Williamson et al. 1992](<https://doi.org/10.1016/S0021-9991(05)80016-6>)

The task `geostrophic/convergence_both` is a space-and-time convergence test
with time step varying proportionately to grid size. Convergence tests in
either space or time are also available as `convergence_space` or 
`convergence_time`. The result of the `analysis` step of the task are plots
like the following showing convergence of water-column thickness and normal
velocity as functions of the mesh resolution:

```

Visualizations of the fields themselves can be added in viz steps by appending
`with_viz` to the task name at setup.

## suppported models

These tasks support only MPAS-Ocean.

## mesh

The mesh is global and can be constructed either as quasi-uniform or
icosahedral. At least three resolutions must be chosen for the mesh
convergence study. The base meshes are the same as used in
{ref}`ocean-cosine-bell`.  See cosine bell's {ref}`ocean-cosine-bell-mesh`
section for more details.

## vertical grid

This test case only exercises the shallow water dynamics. As such, the minimum
number of vertical levels may be used. The bottom depth is constant and the
results should be insensitive to the choice of `bottom_depth`.  See cosine
bell's {ref}`ocean-cosine-bell-vertical` section for the config options.

## initial conditions

The steady-state fields are given by the following equations:

$$
u & = u_0 (\cos\theta \cos\alpha + \cos\lambda \sin\theta \sin\alpha)\\
v & = -u_0 \sin\lambda \sin\alpha\\
h & = h_0 - 1/g (a \Omega u_0 + u_0^2/2)(-\cos\lambda \cos\theta \sin\alpha + \sin\theta \cos\alpha)^2
$$

where

$$
u_0 & = 2 \pi a/(12 \textrm{ days})\\
h_0 & = (1/g) \, 2.94 \times 10^{4} \textrm{m}^2/\textrm{s}^2 \\
\alpha & = 0
$$

:align: center
:width: 500 px
```

```{image} images/geostrophic_u.png
:align: center
:width: 500 px
```

In this test case, the initial fields are given their steady-state values
and the simulation should not diverge significantly from those values.

In this test case, the bottom topography is flat so initial conditions are
given for `bottomDepth` and `ssh` such that `h = bottomDepth + ssh`.

The initial conditions also includes the coriolis parameter, given as:

$$
f = 2 \Omega (-\cos\lambda \cos\theta \sin\alpha + \sin\theta \cos\alpha)
$$

In future work, alpha may be varied to test the sensitivity to orientation:

$$
\alpha = [0, 0.05, \pi/2 - 0.05, \pi/2]
$$

## forcing

Probably N/A but see Williamson's text about the possibility of prescribing a
wind field.

## time step and run duration

This task uses the Runge-Kutta 4th-order (RK4) time integrator. The time step
for forward integration is determined by multiplying the resolution by a config
option, `rk4_dt_per_km`, so that coarser meshes have longer time steps. You can
alter this before setup (in a user config file) or before running the task (in
the config file in the work directory).

```cfg
# config options for convergence tests
[convergence_forward]

# time integrator: {'split_explicit', 'RK4'}
time_integrator = RK4

# RK4 time step per resolution (s/km), since dt is proportional to resolution
rk4_dt_per_km = 2.0
```

The `convergence_eval_time`, `run_duration` and `output_interval` are all 5
days (120 hours):

```cfg

# config options for convergence tests
[convergence]

# Evaluation time for convergence analysis (in hours)
convergence_eval_time = 120.0

# config options for convergence forward steps
[convergence_forward]

# Run duration in hours
run_duration = ${convergence:convergence_eval_time}

# Output interval in hours
output_interval = ${run_duration}
```

Here, `${convergence:convergence_eval_time}` means that the same value is used
as in the option `convergence_eval_time` in section `[convergence]`.

## analysis

For analysis we compute the $l_1$, $l_2$ and $l_{\inf}$ error norms of h and
velocity relative to the steady-state solutions given above.

First, each of these errors norms are plotted vs time for a given resolution.

Then, mesh convergence is examined by plotting the $l_2$ and $l_{\inf}$ norms
at day 5 vs resolution.

## config options

The `geostrophic` config options include:

```cfg
# options for geostrophic convergence test case
[geostrophic]

# period of the velocity in days
vel_period = 12.0

# reference water column thickness (m^2/s^2)
gh_0 = 2.94e4

# angle of velocity field variation
alpha = 0.0

# the constant temperature of the domain
temperature = 15.0

# the constant salinity of the domain
salinity = 35.0
```
These are the basic constants used to initialize the test case according to
the Williams et al. (1992) paper.  The temperature and salinity are arbitrary,
since they do not vary in space and should not affect the evolution.

Three additional config options relate to detecting when the convergence rate
for the water-column thickness (h) and normal velocity (using the L2 norm to
compute the error).  If either convergence rate is unexpectedly low an error is
raised:
```cfg
# config options for convergence tests
[convergence]

# Type of error to compute
error_type = l2

# options for geostrophic convergence test case
[geostrophic]

# convergence threshold below which the test fails
convergence_thresh_h = 0.4
convergence_thresh_normalVelocity = 1.3
```

The convergence rate of the water-column thickness for this test case is very
low for the QU meshes in MPAS-Ocean, about 0.5, which necessitates the very
generous  convergence threshold used here.

Config options related to visualization are as follows.  The options in
`geostropnic_viz` are related to remapping to a regular latitude-longitude
grid.  The remaining options are related to plotting water-column thickness
(`h`) and velocities (`u` and `v`) and the difference between
these fields at initialization and after the 5-day run.

```cfg
# options for plotting water-column thickness from the geostrophic test
[geostrophic_viz_h]

# colormap options
# colormap
colormap_name = cmo.deep

# the type of norm used in the colormap
norm_type = linear

# colorbar limits
colorbar_limits = 1000.0, 3000.0

# colorbar label
label = water-column thickness (m)

# options for plotting velocity from the geostrophic test
[geostrophic_viz_vel]

# colormap options
# colormap
colormap_name = cmo.delta

# the type of norm used in the colormap
norm_type = linear

# colorbar limits
colorbar_limits = -40.0, 40.0

# colorbar label
label = velocity (m/s)

# options for plotting water-column thickness from the geostrophic test
[geostrophic_viz_diff_h]

# colormap options
# colormap
colormap_name = cmo.balance

# the type of norm used in the colormap
norm_type = linear

# colorbar limits
colorbar_limits = -10.0, 10.0

# colorbar label
label = water-column thickness (m)

# options for plotting velocity from the geostrophic test
[geostrophic_viz_diff_vel]

# colormap options
# colormap
colormap_name = cmo.balance

# the type of norm used in the colormap
norm_type = linear

# colorbar limits
colorbar_limits = -0.3, 0.3

# colorbar label
label = velocity (m/s)
```

## cores

The number of cores for each step is handled in the same way as the cosine
bell test.  See that test's {ref}`ocean-cosine-bell-cores` section for details.
