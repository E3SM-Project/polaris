(ocean-single-column)=

# single column

## description

The single column tests in `polaris.tasks.ocean.single_column` exercise
the vertical dynamics of the ocean model only. The test cases are:

- Testing the vertical mixing library, CVMix, under surface forcing
- Testing the Ekman solution under wind forcing
- Testing the Ideal Age tracer under surface forcing
- Testing the Coriolis term by quantifying the inertial frequency

## suppported models

These tasks support only MPAS-Ocean.

## mesh

The mesh is planar and spans the minimum number of cells (16 for MPAS-Ocean).
The config options `lx` and `ly` are given arbitrarily small values of 1 m in
order to ensure that the minimum number of cells is chosen.

By virtue of testing the vertical dynamics, these tests should be insensitive
to the horizontal resolution. As such, only 960 m horizontal resolution is
currently supported.

## vertical grid

Currently, these tests feature a very fine vertical resolution of 4 m
with 100 vertical levels.

## config options

```cfg
# Options related to the vertical grid
[vertical_grid]

# the type of vertical grid
grid_type = uniform

# Number of vertical levels
vert_levels = 100

# Depth of the bottom of the ocean
bottom_depth = 400.0

# The type of vertical coordinate (e.g. z-level, z-star)
coord_type = z-star

# Whether to use "partial" or "full", or "None" to not alter the topography
partial_cell_type = None

# The minimum fraction of a layer for partial cells
min_pc_fraction = 0.1
```

## initial conditions

The temperature and salinity profiles are defined using the following equations:

$$
\Phi(z) = \begin{cases}
    \Phi_0 &\text{ if } z = z[0]\\
    \Phi_0 + {d\Phi/dz}_{ML} z &
    \text{ if } z > z_{MLD}\\
    (\Phi_0 + {\Delta\Phi}_{ML}) + {d\Phi/dz}_{int} (z - z_{MLD}) &
    \text{ if } z \le z_{MLD}
\end{cases}
$$

where $\Phi_0 = $`surface_X`, ${d\Phi/dz}_{ML} = $`X_gradient_mixed_layer`,
$z_{MLD} = -$`mixed_layer_depth_X`, ${\Delta\Phi}_{ML} = $
`X_difference_across_mixed_layer`, and ${d\Phi/dz}_{int} = $
`X_gradient_interior`. `X` in the config options above is either `temperature`
or `salinity`.

The initial velocity is vertically uniform and given by
`single_column:zonal_velocity` and `single_column:meridional_velocity`, which
are 0 by default (at rest).

The Coriolis parameter is spatially constant and set equal to
`coriolis_parameter`.

### forcing

Default values of no forcing are given here, which are then overwritten by the
config options for various test cases. The rates for surface restoring are also
given here, but are only used when the namelist options in `forward.yaml` turn
surface restoring on.

```cfg
# config options for forcing single column testcases
[single_column_forcing]

# Piston velocity to control rate of restoring toward temperature_surface_restoring_value
temperature_piston_velocity = 4.0e-6

# Piston velocity to control rate of restoring toward salinity_surface_restoring_value
salinity_piston_velocity = 4.0e-6

# Temperature to restore towards when surface restoring is turned on
temperature_surface_restoring_value = ${single_column:surface_temperature}

# Salinity to restore towards when surface restoring is turned on
salinity_surface_restoring_value = ${single_column:surface_salinity}

# Rate at which temperature is restored toward the initial condition
temperature_interior_restoring_rate = 1.0e-6

# Rate at which salinity is restored toward the initial condition
salinity_interior_restoring_rate = 1.0e-6

# Net latent heat flux applied when bulk forcing is used. Positive values indicate a net
# input of heat to ocean
latent_heat_flux = 0.0

# Net sensible heat flux applied when bulk forcing is used. Positive values indicate a
# net input of heat to ocean
sensible_heat_flux = 0.0

# Net solar shortwave heat flux applied when bulk forcing is used. Positive values
# indicate a net input of heat to ocean
shortwave_heat_flux = 0.0

# Net surface evaporation when bulk forcing is used. Positive values indicate a net
# input of water to ocean
evaporation_flux = 0.0

# Net surface rain flux when bulk forcing is used. Positive values indicate a net input
# of water to ocean
rain_flux = 0.0

# Net surface river runoff flux when bulk forcing is used. Positive values indicate a net
#flux of water to ocean
river_runoff_flux = 0.0

# Net surface subglacial runoff flux when bulk forcing is used. Positive values indicate a net
#flux of water to ocean
subglacial_runoff_flux = 0.0

# Net surface ice runoff flux when bulk forcing is used. Positive values indicate a net
#flux of water to ocean
ice_runoff_flux = 0.0

# Net iceberg freshwater flux when bulk forcing is used. Positive values indicate a net
#flux of water to ocean
iceberg_flux = 0.0

# Zonal surface wind stress over the domain
wind_stress_zonal = 0.0

# Meridional surface wind stress over the domain
wind_stress_meridional = 0.0
```

## config options

```cfg
# config options for single column testcases
[single_column]

# size of the domain (typically the minimum allowed size of 4x4 cells)
nx = 4
ny = 4

# resolution in km
resolution = 960.0

# Surface temperature
surface_temperature = 20.0

# Temperature gradient in the mixed layer in degC/m
temperature_gradient_mixed_layer = 0.0

# The temperature below the mixed layer
temperature_difference_across_mixed_layer = 0.0

# Temperature gradient below the mixed layer
temperature_gradient_interior = 0.0

# Depth of the temperature mixed layer
mixed_layer_depth_temperature =  0.0

# Surface salinity
surface_salinity = 35.0

# Salinity gradient in the mixed layer in PSU/m
salinity_gradient_mixed_layer = 0.0

# The salinity below the mixed layer
salinity_difference_across_mixed_layer = 0.0

# Salinity gradient below the mixed layer
salinity_gradient_interior = 0.0

# Depth of the salinity mixed layer
mixed_layer_depth_salinity = 0.0

# coriolis parameter
coriolis_parameter = 1.0e-4
```

See mesh section for a description of `lx` and `ly` and initial conditions section for a description of the remaining config options.

## time step and run duration

The time step is given as 10 min and the barotropic time step is 30s in
`forward.yaml`. The run duration is given in the `forward.yaml` file for each
test case. Both can be changed after set-up by modifying the namelist file.

## cores

Both default and minimum number of cores are hard-coded as 1 given that the
domain is only 16 cells.

# Depth of the temperature mixed layer
mixed_layer_depth_temperature =  25.0

# The salinity below the mixed layer
salinity_difference_across_mixed_layer = 1.0
```

The `ekman` test compares the modeled Ekman boundary layer with an [analytic
solution](https://doi.org/10.1126/science.238.4833.1534)

The modeled and analytic solutions for MPAS-Ocean with the default settings

# Zonal surface wind stress over the domain
wind_stress_zonal = 0.1
```

### time step and run duration

The time step is given in {ref}`ocean-single-column`. The run duration is 5
days.

### config options


[single_column_ekman]
