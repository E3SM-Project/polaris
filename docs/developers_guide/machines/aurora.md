# Aurora

## oneapi-ifx

This is the default polaris compiler on Aurora.  If the environment has
been set up properly (see {ref}`dev-conda-env`), you should be able to source:

```bash
source load_dev_polaris_0.10.0-alpha.1_aurora_oneapi-ifx_mpich.sh
```

MPAS components do not yet support Aurora, but Omega does.
