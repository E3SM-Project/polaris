# Deployment and Testing

Once you have a branch with updated Spack packages and you have bumped the
Polaris version, it must be thoroughly tested across supported HPC systems
before a final deployment of the shared Spack environments can occur. This
phase ensures compatibility with system modules and successful runs of
designated test suites for each E3SM component supported by Polaris.
