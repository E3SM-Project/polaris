# Base Mesh Task

The the base mesh tasks defined by {py:class}`polaris.tasks.mesh.base.BaseMeshTask`
can be used to generate quasi-uniform (`qu`) and subdivided icosahedral
(`icos`) spherical meshes at quasi-uniform resolutions ranging from 30 to 480
km.  These "base" meshes cover the full sphere (include both continents and
ocean regions).
