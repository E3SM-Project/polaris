# component_inputs

The `polaris.tasks.e3sm.init.component_inputs` package stages the input files
an E3SM run needs from one unified mesh.  See
{ref}`e3sm-init-component-inputs-tasks` for what it produces and how to run it.

## Import direction

This package lives in `e3sm/init` and imports from `polaris.tasks.ocean`,
while `polaris.tasks.ocean.realistic_global` imports from
`polaris.tasks.e3sm.init.topo.cull`.  That is acyclic only in one direction,
and it works because `polaris.tasks` fully imports
`polaris.tasks.e3sm.init` before any `add_*_tasks` function runs.

**Nothing under `polaris.tasks.ocean` may import this package.**  Reversing
the direction is the kind of change a well-meaning refactor makes, and it
fails as an import error that is hard to place.

## Steps

`get_component_inputs_steps(mesh_name, target)` follows the same pattern as
`get_cull_topo_steps` and `get_realistic_dynamic_adjustment_steps`: every step
comes from `Component.get_or_create_shared_step`, so the three tasks that
share most of these steps get the same instances.

It builds **only what `target` needs**.  That is what makes the sea-ice target
independent of the ocean in the sense that matters: asking for `seaice` does
not create the dynamic-adjustment chain at all, so a sea-ice task cannot end
up waiting on a model run it has no use for.

| Step | Reads | Writes |
|---|---|---|
| `BaseMeshStep` | `base_mesh.nc`, the three `*_map_culled_to_base.nc` | `base_mesh_with_maps.nc` |
| `ScripStep` | the cull step's three SCRIP files | `<region>.scrip.nc` |
| `OceanMeshStep` | the initial state's `mesh.nc` and `init.nc` | `ocean_mesh.nc` |
| `OceanInitialConditionStep` | the final adjustment stage's restart | `ocean_initial_condition.nc` |
| `OceanGraphPartitionStep` | `culled_ocean_graph.info` | `mpas-o.graph.info.part.*` |
| `SeaiceMeshStep` | `culled_ocean_mesh.nc` | `seaice_mesh.nc` |
| `SeaiceInitialConditionStep` | `culled_ocean_mesh.nc` | `seaice_initial_condition.nc` |
| `SeaicePartitionMapStep` | `seaice_mesh.nc`, QU60km climatology | the QU60km-to-mesh mapping file |
| `SeaiceGraphPartitionStep` | `seaice_mesh.nc`, QU60km climatology and ice-present mask, the mapping file | `mpas-seaice.graph.info.part.*` |
| `AssembleStep` | the above | `assembled_files/` |

The sea-ice partitioning is two steps rather than one because building the
remapping weights is an MPI job sized for the mapping tool, while using them
is serial.  `SeaicePartitionMapStep` descends from
{py:class}`polaris.remap.MappingFileStep`; `SeaiceGraphPartitionStep` depends
on it and reads the weights off its remapper, since the mapping file's path is
not known until it has run.  This is the same division `realistic_global` uses
between `Woa23MapStep` and `RemapWoa23Step`.

Work directories are `e3sm/init/<mesh>/component_inputs/<step_name>`, and the
tasks are at `e3sm/init/<mesh>/component_inputs/tasks/{ocean,seaice,all}`.
Putting the tasks under `tasks/` keeps a task subdirectory from colliding with
a step subdirectory, which is a real risk when three tasks share most of their
steps.

## What is not recomputed

The cull step already writes the SCRIP descriptions, the ocean graph and the
culled-to-base index maps, and the initial-state step already writes every
vertical-coordinate field.  Several steps that were computations in Compass
are therefore staging or inversion here:

- `BaseMeshStep` **inverts** the existing forward maps rather than
  recomputing them.  They came from a nearest-element query far more expensive
  than a scatter, and inverting is what guarantees the two directions agree.
- `ScripStep` only restamps `mesh_name`, using `ncatted` rather than an
  xarray round-trip.  These are `NETCDF3_64BIT_DATA` files the cull step
  already found prohibitively slow to write directly.
- `OceanMeshStep` selects rather than computes; only `zMid` and
  `refLayerThickness` are built here.

## Leaf modules

`names.py`, `maps.py`, `partitions.py` and `models.py` open no file and
construct no step, so the naming rules, the index inversion, the core-count
list and the model gate are all unit testable without a work directory.

- `names.py` — every staged path is a function here, so the layout of the
  assembled tree is described in one place.
- `maps.py` — `map_base_to_culled` and `base_to_culled_maps`.  Both check that
  every forward-map value is a valid base index and that no base index appears
  twice; a violation means a stale file from a different mesh, which would
  otherwise scatter into a plausible-looking wrong answer.
- `partitions.py` — `get_core_list`, ported essentially verbatim from Compass,
  plus `read_graph_cell_count`, which reads the METIS header rather than
  counting lines.
- `models.py` — the ocean and sea-ice model gates.  Built while only MPAS is
  supported so that adding Omega fills a named gap rather than retrofitting
  model selection into steps that quietly assumed MPAS.

## Sea-ice does not touch the ocean

Compass copied `fCell`, `fEdge` and `fVertex` out of an ocean restart and
partitioned that restart's mesh.  Both are removed here: the Coriolis fields
are computed from latitude with `add_spherical_coriolis`, and the partitioning
reads `SeaiceMeshStep`'s output.

`add_spherical_coriolis` is called directly rather than through
`add_coriolis_to_dataset`, which would read `[coriolis] type` from a config
section a sea-ice step has no business reading — and whose default of `zero`
would be silently wrong here.

## Staging happens only in the assembly step

Product steps write only their own outputs; `AssembleStep` declares those
outputs as inputs and materializes the tree.  Compass scatters `symlink()`
calls through the product steps, which is what makes its `assembled_files`
tree hard to reason about.

Graph partitions are the exception to declaring outputs: which core counts
exist follows from a cell count that is not known until the graph file has
been written, so they cannot be named at setup.  `AssembleStep` lists what the
partition step produced and raises if it produced nothing.
